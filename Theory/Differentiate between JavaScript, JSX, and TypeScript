TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning all JavaScript is TypeScript, but not all TypeScript is JavaScript. React allows you to choose whether to use either JavaScript or TypeScript. Before we discuss why you may want to choose TypeScript over JavaScript, let’s learn a little more about TypeScript.

TypeScript is a compiled language that supports type-checking. TypeScript is statically typed. This means that variables are static. Once they are defined, a variable’s type, such as “num” or “string,” cannot be changed. A variable that is declared a number cannot later take a string value. Using TypeScript can save a lot of headaches later to help avoid “run-time errors” when the code is being run or avoid hard-to-identify bugs during testing. With TypeScript many of these errors are identified as “type errors” during compilation rather than “undefined” bugs at run-time. During compilation of the Typescript code, this is called “type checking,” where the compiler ensures that once a variable is declared, it is not reassigned to another data type.

Now let’s explore the relationship between JSX and TypeScript. Recall that JSX provides additional syntax to JavaScript, allowing you to write HTML-like code for JavaScript. JSX requires a compiler to translate the JSX into JavaScript. Babel is a popular compiler for JSX.

TypeScript supports embedding. This means you can embed HTML directly into TypeScript, and the compiler will translate the HTML and the TypeScript into JavaScript at compile time, similarly to how the Babel compiler translates JSX into JavaScript.

 First of all, Babel does not support type-checking. Secondly, the TypeScript compiler compiles the entire project simultaneously rather than one file at a time. This means that type errors are caught amongst different files rather than only within a single file.

There are several advantages to using TypeScript rather than JavaScript in your React application and possibly a few drawbacks. Regarding advantages:

TypeScript makes it easy to define Prop types in React. This makes writing code with an IDE that supports code completion a breeze since the IDE automatically populates the Prop type.

Most common third-party libraries support TypeScript definitions.

As mentioned, TypeScript has static type-checking, which enables you to help identify errors earlier in the development process.

Refactoring code becomes easier since types are known.

There will be fewer “undefined” errors at run-time due to type-checking at compile time.

Code is easier to read and maintain than JavaScript due to typed variables.

You can still write JavaScript and use the TypeScript compiler.

There are also possibly a few challenges with using TypeScript rather than JavaScript for React applications:

There is a learning curve

Compilation takes a little longer than using Babel with JSX

Third-party libraries could be missing Type definitions, though this is rare because TypeScript has grown very popular
